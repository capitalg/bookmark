## Motivation

A handy app to showcase your bookshelf in your portfolio, while also taking notes for your next blog.

I imagine this to be a `/books`-like extention to portfolio sites, with an optional private mode where you can take notes. These notes can translate nicely to blog posts, which further build your online portfolio :)

Mostly started this to dive deeper into a few things that interested me:

**Frontend**

1. React Hooks (about time..)
1. CSS-in-JS (styled-components)
1. PWAs
1. Offline Mode

**Backend**

1. GraphQL
1. Node.js
1. Docker/Kubernetes
1. MongoDB

I'll probably also play around with complete offline mode, background sync jobs, CRDTs, etc.
